## Release Notes

### Version 05 (June 22, 2006)

Disabled Strength and Agility bonus displays due to lack of confirmation and accuracy.

Changed human random skill bonus for hp and mp to be 1% every 10 levels.

### Version 04 (October 18, 2005)

Adjusted +bases to account for Xenimus 1.83 update.

Notes:
The human hp/mp check boxes are for the random +% skill humans can get.
Remember that some items have built in +% hp/mp beyond what you get from propping.

### Version 03 (August 31, 2005)

Added Paladin mana for full alignment.

### Version 02 (August 29, 2005)

Changed mana cost for Juxta. The ones with ~ were estimated (33% decrease from original cost)

All "starter help" functions were removed, I never used them myself and felt they were wasting space.

When you hit a new bonus for a stat, a red square will appear to the right of the stat.

You can now save and reload stats at the bottom of the calc. When you save them, the info will write to a
DAT file that can be read in at any time. Click on the file name in the left list box then push the load
button. To delete any saved stat files, click on the file then push the delete button (or do it manually).
An example stat file has been included, feel free to delete it at any time.

The full alignment button has been disabled so non-clerics can't even try to use it. It was fine the way
it was before since it wouldn't let non-clerics use it anyway, but now it's grayed out and disabled. So stop
trying to use full alignment on regular chars. Paladin alignment is still not implemented because no testing
has been done for them. Don't expect it to be added any time soon.

### Version 01 (June 15, 2005)

I commented it all the best I could... 
I used MS Visual C++ 6.0, and it's an MFC static-linked app 

If you can't compile it, there is an already compiled copy in the 'Release' folder. 

If you're going to make changes to it, add your name and what additions you made to the
top of the file you changed... and keep all previous names of other people on there also.
ALWAYS submit the source code when you release any changes. 

Oh, and edit the icon to be your own (erase the HTech and add some other name there)

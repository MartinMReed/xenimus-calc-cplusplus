## Release Notes

### Version 01 (June 15, 2005)

I commented it all the best I could... 
I used MS Visual C++ 6.0, and it's an MFC static-linked app 

If you can't compile it, there is an already compiled copy in the 'Release' folder. 

If your going to make changes to it, add your name and what additions you made to the
top of the file you changed... and keep all previous names of other people on there also.
ALWAYS submit the source code when you release any changes. 

Oh, and edit the icon to be your own (erase the HTech and add some other name there)
